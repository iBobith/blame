    "Infrastructure": [
      "A vast, empty chamber of polished, black stone, stretching into an oppressive darkness. The air is still and cold, carrying the faint, metallic tang of decay.",
      "A narrow corridor, its walls a mosaic of corroded metal and flickering emergency lights. A low, rhythmic hum resonates from deep within the structure, a constant reminder of the city's unseen mechanisms.",
      "A wide platform, precariously suspended over a seemingly bottomless chasm. The silence here is heavy, broken only by the distant, echoing drip of unseen water. Below, faint, unidentifiable lights twinkle in the abyss.",
      "A junction of several identical-looking passageways, each disappearing into the gloom. A faint, unpleasant smell, like ozone and damp concrete, lingers in the stagnant air.",
      "A collapsed section of a walkway, twisted girders and shattered plasteel scattered everywhere. The path ahead is treacherous, demanding careful navigation over the debris of a forgotten catastrophe.",
      "A cavernous space, once a grand concourse, now choked with the skeletal remains of colossal machinery. Dust motes dance in the weak, filtered light, illuminating the scale of the city's ambition and its subsequent ruin."
    ],
    "Residential": [
      "A small, cubical room with walls made of a strange, porous material that seems to absorb all sound. The air is stale, carrying the faint, ghost-like scent of long-departed inhabitants.",
      "A series of interconnected pods, their transparent fronts clouded with grime and age. Each pod tells a silent story of a life abruptly ended or abandoned, personal effects frozen in time.",
      "A communal living area, now silent and covered in a thick blanket of dust. Faded murals on the walls depict a utopian vision that starkly contrasts with the current desolation.",
      "A cramped living space, the personal effects of its former owner long gone, leaving only faint impressions on the grimy surfaces. The silence is profound, a testament to the city's forgotten populace.",
      "A network of narrow, winding passages, lined with countless identical doors. The air is heavy with the weight of countless forgotten lives, a silent testament to the city's past."
    ],
    "Industrial": [
      "A room filled with dormant, monolithic machinery, all covered in a thick layer of dust and cobwebs. The sheer scale of the equipment hints at its immense, forgotten purpose.",
      "The corridor opens into a massive, spherical space, its metallic walls adorned with strange, glowing glyphs that pulse with a faint, internal light. The air vibrates with a low, resonant hum.",
      "A factory floor, silent except for the rhythmic dripping of some unknown, viscous fluid from overhead pipes. The air is thick with the smell of rust and decay, a testament to years of neglect.",
      "A maintenance tunnel, a labyrinth of pipes, cables, and conduits. The air is warm and humid, and the distant clanking of unseen mechanisms echoes through the confined space.",
      "A vast, echoing processing plant, its conveyor belts and robotic arms frozen mid-motion. The silence is unnerving, broken only by the occasional creak of settling metal, a ghost of its former industriousness."
